#### Steps Performed
1. Fetch the latest code from Gitlab.
2. Update environment variables to introduce four new variables for MongoDB collections (e.g., provisioning, OCRM) and Keycloak-related configurations, including client IDs for both front-end and back-end clients, as well as UUIDs.
3. Rebuild all microservices.
4. Configure all PM2 processes to run in cluster mode, deploying four nodes per cluster to enhance performance.
5. Execute two new migrations:
	- One for storing user emails during SOF creation.
	- Another for propagating projects.
6. Possible Side Effects/Failures:
	- Due to the inclusion of manual commits and consumers being configured to process Kafka messages from the beginning, there is a potential risk that the processes may pick up older, uncommitted messages. This could result in the creation of duplicate SOFs, tickets. Additionally, the APIs may receive multiple hits from Shakti processes.
	- Previously, projects were created using the user's CRM UUID. However, as communicated by Ragini, projects should now be created using account numbers instead. Consequently, a migration will be executed to refresh all accounts and update their default projects with the new account numbers. The get/create project APIs will be triggered serveral times for each account in Shakti production database.
